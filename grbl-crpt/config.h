// If homing is enabled, homing init lock sets GRBL-CRPT into an alarm state upon power up. This forces
// the user to perform the homing cycle (or override the locks) before doing anything else. This is
// mainly a safety feature to remind the user to home, since position is unknown to GRBL-CRPT.
#define HOMING_INIT_LOCK // Comment to disable

// Define the homing cycle patterns with bitmasks. The homing cycle first performs a search mode
// to quickly engage the limit switches, followed by a slower locate mode, and finished by a short
// pull-off motion to disengage the limit switches. The following HOMING_CYCLE_x defines are executed
// in order starting with suffix 0 and completes the homing routine for the specified-axes only. If
// an axis is omitted from the defines, it will not home, nor will the system update its position.
// Meaning that this allows for users with non-standard cartesian machines, such as a lathe (x then z,
// with no y), to configure the homing cycle behavior to their needs.
// NOTE: The homing cycle is designed to allow sharing of limit pins, if the axes are not in the same
// cycle, but this requires some pin settings changes in cpu_map.h file. For example, the default homing
// cycle can share the Z limit pin with either X or Y limit pins, since they are on different cycles.
// By sharing a pin, this frees up a precious IO pin for other purposes. In theory, all axes limit pins
// may be reduced to one pin, if all axes are homed with seperate cycles, or vice versa, all three axes
// on separate pin, but homed in one cycle. Also, it should be noted that the function of hard limits
// will not be affected by pin sharing.

// If your machine has two limits switches wired in parallel to one axis, you will need to enable
// this feature. Since the two switches are sharing a single pin, there is no way for GRBL-CRPT to tell
// which one is enabled. This option only effects homing, where if a limit is engaged, GRBL-CRPT will
// alarm out and force the user to manually disengage the limit switch. Otherwise, if you have one
// limit switch for each axis, don't enable this option. By keeping it disabled, you can perform a
// homing cycle while on the limit switch and not have to move the machine off of it.
// #define LIMITS_TWO_SWITCHES_ON_AXES

// Allows GRBL-CRPT to track and report gcode line numbers.  Enabling this means that the planning buffer
// goes from 16 to 15 to make room for the additional line number data in the plan_block_t struct
// #define USE_LINE_NUMBERS // Disabled by default. Uncomment to enable.

// This option causes the feed hold input to act as a safety door switch. A safety door, when triggered,
// immediately forces a feed hold and then safely de-energizes the machine. Resuming is blocked until
// the safety door is re-engaged. When it is, GRBL-CRPT will re-energize the machine and then resume on the
// previous tool path, as if nothing happened.
// #define ENABLE_SAFETY_DOOR_INPUT_PIN // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable.

// Enable CoreXY kinematics. Use ONLY with CoreXY machines.
// IMPORTANT: If homing is enabled, you must reconfigure the homing cycle #defines above to
// #define HOMING_CYCLE_0 (1<<X_AXIS) and #define HOMING_CYCLE_1 (1<<Y_AXIS)
// NOTE: This configuration option alters the motion of the X and Y axes to principle of operation
// defined at (http://corexy.com/theory.html). Motors are assumed to positioned and wired exactly as
// described, if not, motions may move in strange directions. GRBL-CRPT requires the CoreXY A and B motors
// have the same steps per mm internally.
// #define COREXY // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable.

// Inverts pin logic of the control command pins based on a mask. This essentially means you can use
// normally-closed switches on the specified pins, rather than the default normally-open switches.
// NOTE: The top option will mask and invert all control pins. The bottom option is an example of
// inverting only two control pins, the safety door and reset. See cpu_map.h for other bit definitions.
// #define INVERT_CONTROL_PIN_MASK CONTROL_MASK // Default disabled. Uncomment to disable.
// #define INVERT_CONTROL_PIN_MASK ((1<<CONTROL_SAFETY_DOOR_BIT)|(1<<CONTROL_RESET_BIT)) // Default disabled.

// Inverts select limit pin states based on the following mask. This effects all limit pin functions,
// such as hard limits and homing. However, this is different from overall invert limits setting.
// This build option will invert only the limit pins defined here, and then the invert limits setting
// will be applied to all of them. This is useful when a user has a mixed set of limit pins with both
// normally-open(NO) and normally-closed(NC) switches installed on their machine.
// NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS, unless you have a situation that needs it.
// #define INVERT_LIMIT_PIN_MASK ((1<<X_LIMIT_BIT)|(1<<Y_LIMIT_BIT)) // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable.

// When GRBL-CRPT powers-cycles or is hard reset with the Arduino reset button, GRBL-CRPT boots up with no ALARM
// by default. This is to make it as simple as possible for new users to start using GRBL-CRPT. When homing
// is enabled and a user has installed limit switches, GRBL-CRPT will boot up in an ALARM state to indicate
// GRBL-CRPT doesn't know its position and to force the user to home before proceeding. This option forces
// GRBL-CRPT to always initialize into an ALARM state regardless of homing or not. This option is more for
// OEMs and LinuxCNC users that would like this power-cycle behavior.
// #define FORCE_INITIALIZATION_ALARM // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable.

// At power-up or a reset, GRBL-CRPT will check the limit switch states to ensure they are not active
// before initialization. If it detects a problem and the hard limits setting is enabled, GRBL-CRPT will
// simply message the user to check the limits and enter an alarm state, rather than idle. GRBL-CRPT will
// not throw an alarm message.

// When a M2 or M30 program end command is executed, most g-code states are restored to their defaults.

// to their default values at program end.
#define RESTORE_OVERRIDES_AFTER_PROGRAM_END // Default enabled. Comment to disable.

// The upstream Grbl v1.1 status-report change also removed the ability to disable/enable most data
// fields from the report. This caused issues for GUI developers, who've had to manage several scenarios
// and configurations. The increased efficiency of the new reporting style allows for all data fields to 
// be sent without potential performance issues.
// NOTE: The options below are here only provide a way to disable certain data fields if a unique

// Some status report data isn't necessary for realtime, only intermittently, because the values don't

// the associated data is refreshed and included in the status report. However, if one of these value
// changes, GRBL-CRPT will automatically include this data in the next status report, regardless of what the
// count is at the time. This helps reduce the communication overhead involved with high frequency reporting
// and agressive streaming. There is also a busy and an idle refresh count, which sets up GRBL-CRPT to send
// refreshes more often when its not doing anything important. With a good GUI, this data doesn't need
// to be refreshed very often, on the order of a several seconds.

// The temporal resolution of the acceleration management subsystem. A higher number gives smoother
// acceleration, particularly noticeable on machines that run at very high feedrates, but may negatively
// impact performance. The correct value for this parameter is machine dependent, so it's advised to
// set this only as high as needed. Approximate successful values can widely range from 50 to 200 or more.
// NOTE: Changing this value also changes the execution time of a segment in the step segment buffer.
// When increasing this value, this stores less overall time in the segment buffer and vice versa. Make
// certain the step segment buffer is increased/decreased to account for these changes.
#define ACCELERATION_TICKS_PER_SECOND 100

// Adaptive Multi-Axis Step Smoothing (AMASS) is an advanced feature that does what its name implies,
// smoothing the stepping of multi-axis motions. This feature smooths motion particularly at low step
// frequencies below 10kHz, where the aliasing between axes of multi-axis motions can cause audible
// noise and shake your machine. At even lower step frequencies, AMASS adapts and provides even better
// step smoothing. See stepper.c for more details on the AMASS system works.
#define ADAPTIVE_MULTI_AXIS_STEP_SMOOTHING  // Default enabled. Comment to disable.

// Sets the maximum step rate allowed to be written as a GRBL-CRPT setting. This option enables an error
// check in the settings module to prevent settings values that will exceed this limitation. The maximum
// step rate is strictly limited by the CPU speed and will change if something other than an AVR running
// at 16MHz is used.
// NOTE: For now disabled, will enable if flash space permits.
// #define MAX_STEP_RATE_HZ 30000 // Hz

// By default, GRBL-CRPT sets all input pins to normal-high operation with their internal pull-up resistors
// enabled. This simplifies the wiring for users by requiring only a switch connected to ground,
// although its recommended that users take the extra step of wiring in low-pass filter to reduce
// electrical noise detected by the pin. If the user inverts the pin in GRBL-CRPT settings, this just flips
// which high or low reading indicates an active signal. In normal operation, this means the user
// needs to connect a normal-open switch, but if inverted, this means the user should connect a
// normal-closed switch.
// The following options disable the internal pull-up resistors, sets the pins to a normal-low
// operation, and switches must be now connect to Vcc instead of ground. This also flips the meaning
// of the invert pin GRBL-CRPT setting, where an inverted setting now means the user should connect a
// normal-open switch and vice versa.
// NOTE: All pins associated with the feature are disabled, i.e. XYZ limit pins, not individual axes.
// WARNING: When the pull-ups are disabled, this requires additional wiring with pull-down resistors!
//#define DISABLE_LIMIT_PIN_PULL_UP
//#define DISABLE_CONTROL_PIN_PULL_UP

// Sets which axis the tool length offset is applied.

// With this enabled, GRBL-CRPT sends back an echo of the line it has received, which has been pre-parsed (spaces
// removed, capitalized letters, no comments) and is to be immediately executed by GRBL-CRPT. Echoes will not be
// sent upon a line buffer overflow, but should for all normal lines sent to GRBL-CRPT. For example, if a user
// sendss the line 'g1 x1.032 y2.45 (test comment)', GRBL-CRPT will echo back in the form '[echo: G1X1.032Y2.45]'.
// NOTE: Only use this for debugging purposes!! When echoing, this takes up valuable resources and can effect
// performance. If absolutely needed for normal operation, the serial write buffer should be greatly increased

// #define REPORT_ECHO_LINE_RECEIVED // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable.

// Minimum planner junction speed. Sets the default minimum junction speed the planner plans to at
// every buffer block junction, except for starting from rest and end of the buffer, which are always
// zero. This value controls how fast the machine moves through junctions with no regard for acceleration
// limits or angle between neighboring block line move directions. This is useful for machines that can't
// tolerate the tool dwelling for a split second, such as lightweight gantries or other low-inertia motion systems. If used, this value
// should not be much greater than zero or to the minimum value necessary for the machine to work.
#define MINIMUM_JUNCTION_SPEED 0.0 // (mm/min)

// Sets the minimum feed rate the planner will allow. Any value below it will be set to this minimum
// value. This also ensures that a planned motion always completes and accounts for any floating-point
// round-off errors. Although not recommended, a lower value than 1.0 mm/min will likely work in smaller

// Number of arc generation iterations by small angle approximation before exact arc trajectory

// The arc G2/3 g-code standard is problematic by definition. Radius-based arcs have horrible numerical
// errors when arc at semi-circles(pi) or full-circles(2*pi). Offset-based arcs are much more accurate
// but still have a problem when arcs are full-circles (2*pi). This define accounts for the floating
// point issues when offset-based arcs are commanded as full circles, but get interpreted as extremely
// small arcs with around machine epsilon (1.2e-7rad) due to numerical round-off and precision issues.
// This define value sets the machine epsilon cutoff to determine if the arc is a full-circle or not.
// NOTE: Be very careful when adjusting this value. It should always be greater than 1.2e-7 but not too
// much greater than this. The default setting should capture most, if not all, full arc error situations.
#define ARC_ANGULAR_TRAVEL_EPSILON 5E-7 // Float (radians)

// Time delay increments performed during a dwell. The default value is set at 50ms, which provides
// a maximum time delay of roughly 55 minutes, more than enough for most any application. Increasing
// this delay will increase the maximum dwell time linearly, but also reduces the responsiveness of
// run-time command executions, like status reports, since these are performed between each dwell
// time step. Also, keep in mind that the Arduino delay timer is not very accurate for long delays.
#define DWELL_TIME_STEP 50 // Integer (1-255) (milliseconds)

// Creates a delay between the direction pin setting and corresponding step pulse by creating
// another interrupt (Timer2 compare) to manage it. The main GRBL-CRPT interrupt (Timer1 compare)
// sets the direction pins, and does not immediately set the stepper pins, as it would in
// normal operation. The Timer2 compare fires next to set the stepper pins after the step
// pulse delay time, and Timer2 overflow will complete the step pulse, except now delayed
// by the step pulse time plus the step pulse delay. (Thanks langwadt for the idea!)
// NOTE: Uncomment to enable. The recommended delay must be > 3us, and, when added with the

// values for certain setups have ranged from 5 to 20us.
// #define STEP_PULSE_DELAY 10 // Step pulse delay in microseconds. Default disabled.

// The number of linear motions in the planner buffer to be planned at any give time. The vast
// majority of RAM that GRBL-CRPT uses is based on this buffer size. Only increase if there is extra

// new incoming motions as they are executed.
// #define BLOCK_BUFFER_SIZE 16 // Uncomment to override default in planner.h.

// Governs the size of the intermediary step segment buffer between the step execution algorithm
// and the planner blocks. Each segment is set of steps executed at a constant velocity over a
// fixed time defined by ACCELERATION_TICKS_PER_SECOND. They are computed such that the planner
// block velocity profile is traced exactly. The size of this buffer governs how much step
// execution lead time there is for other GRBL-CRPT processes have to compute and do their thing
// before having to come back and refill this buffer, currently at ~50msec of step moves.
// #define SEGMENT_BUFFER_SIZE 6 // Uncomment to override default in stepper.h.

// Line buffer size from the serial input stream to be executed. Also, governs the size of
// each of the startup blocks, as they are each stored as a string of this size. Make sure
// to account for the available EEPROM at the defined memory address in settings.h and for
// the number of desired startup blocks.
// NOTE: 80 characters is not a problem except for extreme cases, but the line buffer size
// can be too small and g-code blocks can get truncated. Officially, the g-code standards
// support up to 256 characters. In future versions, this default will be increased, when
// we know how much extra memory space we can re-invest into this.
// #define LINE_BUFFER_SIZE 80  // Uncomment to override default in protocol.h

// Serial send and receive buffer size. The receive buffer is often used as another streaming
// buffer to store incoming blocks to be processed by GRBL-CRPT when its ready. Most streaming
// interfaces will character count and track each block send to each block response. So,
// increase the receive buffer if a deeper receive buffer is needed for streaming and avaiable
// memory allows. The send buffer primarily handles messages in GRBL-CRPT. Only increase if large
// messages are sent and GRBL-CRPT begins to stall, waiting to send the rest of the message.
// NOTE: GRBL-CRPT generates an average status report in about 0.5msec, but the serial TX stream at
// 115200 baud will take 5 msec to transmit a typical 55 character report. Worst case reports are
// around 90-100 characters. As long as the serial TX buffer doesn't get continually maxed, GRBL-CRPT

// A simple software debouncing feature for hard limit switches. When enabled, the interrupt 
// monitoring the hard limit switch pins will enable the Arduino's watchdog timer to re-check 
// the limit pin state after a delay of about 32msec. This can help with CNC machines with 
// problematic false triggering of their hard limit switches, but it WILL NOT fix issues with 
// electrical interference on the signal cables from external sources. It's recommended to first

// work well and are cheap to find) and wire in a low-pass circuit into each limit pin.
// #define ENABLE_SOFTWARE_DEBOUNCE // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable.

// Force GRBL-CRPT to check the state of the hard limit switches when the processor detects a pin
// change inside the hard limit ISR routine. By default, GRBL-CRPT will trigger the hard limits
// alarm upon any pin change, since bouncing switches can cause a state check like this to
// misread the pin. When hard limits are triggered, they should be 100% reliable, which is the
// reason that this option is disabled by default. Only if your system/electronics can guarantee
// that the switches don't bounce, we recommend enabling this option. This will help prevent

// Adjusts homing cycle search and locate scalars. These are the multipliers used by GRBL-CRPT's

// AVR processors require all interrupts to be disabled during an EEPROM write. This includes both
// the stepper ISRs and serial comm ISRs. In the event of a long EEPROM write, this ISR pause can
// cause active stepping to lose position and serial receive data to be lost. This configuration
// option forces the planner buffer to completely empty whenever the EEPROM is written to prevent
// any chance of lost steps.
// However, this doesn't prevent issues with lost serial RX data during an EEPROM write, especially
// if a GUI is premptively filling up the serial RX buffer simultaneously. It's highly advised for
// GUIs to flag these gcodes (G10,G28.1,G30.1) to always wait for an 'ok' after a block containing
// one of these commands before sending more data to eliminate this issue.
// NOTE: Most EEPROM write commands are implicitly blocked during a job (all '$' commands). However,

// In GRBL-CRPT v0.9 and prior, there is an old outstanding bug where the `WPos:` work position reported

// can be several motions behind. This option forces the planner buffer to empty, sync, and stop
// motion whenever there is a command that alters the work coordinate offsets `G10,G43.1,G92,G54-59`.
// This is the simplest way to ensure `WPos:` is always correct. Fortunately, it's exceedingly rare

// Enables and configures parking motion methods upon a safety door state. Primarily for OEMs

// to be easily refactored for any number of motions on different axes by altering the parking
// source code. At this time, GRBL-CRPT only supports parking one axis (typically the Z-axis) that
// moves in the positive direction upon retracting and negative direction upon restoring position.
// The motion executes with a slow pull-out retraction motion, power-down, and a fast park.
// Restoring to the resume position follows these set motions in reverse: fast restore to
// pull-out position, power-up with a time-out, and plunge back to the original position at the
// slower pull-out rate.

  This optional dual axis feature is primarily for the homing cycle to locate two sides of 
  a dual-motor gantry independently, i.e. self-squaring. This requires an additional limit
  switch for the cloned motor. To self square, both limit switches on the cloned axis must
  be physically positioned to trigger when the gantry is square. Highly recommend keeping  
  the motors always enabled to ensure the gantry stays square with the $1=255 setting.

  For GRBL-CRPT on the Arduino Uno, the cloned axis limit switch must to be shared with and 
  wired with z-axis limit pin due to the lack of available pins. The homing cycle must home
  the z-axis and cloned axis in different cycles, which is already the default config.

  The dual axis feature works by cloning an axis step output onto another pair of step
  and direction pins. The step pulse and direction of the cloned motor can be set 
  independently of the main axis motor. However to save precious flash and memory, this
  dual axis feature must share the same settings (step/mm, max speed, acceleration) as the 
  parent motor. This is NOT a feature for an independent fourth axis. Only a motor clone.

  WARNING: Make sure to test the directions of your dual axis motors! They must be setup
  to move the same direction BEFORE running your first homing cycle or any long motion!
  Motors moving in opposite directions can cause serious damage to your machine! Use this 
  dual axis feature at your own risk.

// To prevent the homing cycle from racking the dual axis, when one limit triggers before the

// motor's limit switch does not trigger within the three distance parameters defined below. 
// Axis length percent will automatically compute a fail distance as a percentage of the max
// travel of the other non-dual axis, i.e. if dual axis select is X_AXIS at 5.0%, then the fail 
// distance will be computed as 5.0% of y-axis max travel. Fail distance max and min are the
